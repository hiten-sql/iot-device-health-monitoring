# SQL Industrial IoT Device Monitoring & Operations Analytics

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of production-style SQL queries designed
to monitor, analyze, and track the operational health, productivity, and lifecycle
of large-scale industrial IoT fleets.

The project focuses on real-world operations use cases such as device activation,
connectivity monitoring, fuel data availability, productivity measurement, servicing
estimation, and device onboarding funnels. All datasets and outputs shown are
anonymized and representative.

---

## Key Objectives
- Monitor device installation and activation status in near real time
- Track device connectivity and health based on last ping data
- Identify non-pinging, never-installed, and healthy devices
- Measure daily productivity using distance and engine-hour metrics
- Estimate servicing schedules based on usage
- Analyze device lifecycle drop-offs using funnel logic

---

## 1. Activation Status – Day-wise (Last 24 Hours)

Tracks device installation and activation events recorded during field deployment.
This helps operations teams validate installations and identify pending or delayed
activations.

### Sample Output

| Device ID | Activation Date | Activation Time |     Installation Status    |
|----------:|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------------|
| 252120    | 2025-12-24      | 03:21:38        | Not Successfully Installed |
| 252091    | 2025-12-24      | 03:19:38        | Installed                  |
| 252086    | 2025-12-24      | 03:15:24        | Installed                  |

## 2. Device Health & Fuel Status (Operational View)

Provides a consolidated operational snapshot per device, including:
- Battery voltage
- Last ping date & time (IST)
- Hours since last ping
- Fuel level and fuel data availability
- Overall device health classification

| 252113    | CS11         | New Holland  | 3630 | 14445           | 2025-12-24    | 03:06:00             | 0.30                  | 63.33      | Fuel Data Available | Active (Ping < 7 Days) |
| 252086    | VTR24        | Valtra       | 193  | 14425           | 2025-12-24    | 03:15:24             | 0.14                  | 0          | Fuel Level Zero     | Active (Ping < 7 Days) |

## 3. Active Device Status – 7 Day Health Classification (Pie)
Active (Ping < 7 Days) ██████████████████████████████ 60.6%

Not Installed / Never Pinged ██████████ 21.2%

Active but No Fuel Data ████████ 18.2%

Classifies devices based on recent connectivity to provide a high-level fleet
health overview.

### Device Health Distribution (ASCII Representation)

### Summary Table

| Status Category             | Percentage | Device Count |
|----------------------------|------------|--------------|
| Active (Ping < 7 Days)     | 60.6%      | 40           |
| Not Installed              | 21.2%      | 14           |
| Active but No Fuel Data    | 18.2%      | 12           |
| **Total**                  | **100%**   | **66**       |

## 4. Device Lifecycle Funnel Analysis

Tracks the progression of devices across key onboarding and operational stages,
helping identify drop-offs and inefficiencies in the device lifecycle.

### Funnel Visualization (ASCII)

Tagged Devices ██████████████████████████████ 66

Dealer App Registered ████████████████████████ 52 (78.8%)

KSK / Platform Linked ████████████████████████ 52 (78.8%)

Subscribed Devices ████████████████████████ 52 (78.8%)

Pinged in Last 7 Days ███████████████████ 40 (60.6%)

### Key Observations
- Major drop observed post tagging during dealer registration
- Subscription conversion remains stable after linking
- Connectivity issues account for final funnel drop
