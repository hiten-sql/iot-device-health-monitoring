/*
  Activation Status – Day-wise (Last 24 Hours)
  --------------------------------------------
  This query identifies IoT devices that have been activated in the last 24 hours
  and evaluates installation health based on completion stages and linked data.

  Installation Health Logic:
  - Properly Installed:
      • Primary info stage completed
      • Tractor test stage completed
      • Final test passed
      • Tractor linked
      • Customer phone available
  - Not Properly Installed:
      • Any of the above conditions not met
